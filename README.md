# Cifar-Image-Recognition

This was a project to learn about machine learning to create image recognition software.

The data used to train the model came from the CIFAR-10 set found [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The image set contains 60000 images in 10 classes of images. The classes present are:

- airplane
- automobile
- bird
- cat
- deer
- dog
- frog
- horse
- ship
- truck

## Technologies Used

The project uses Tensorflow and Keras for its deeplearning apis.

## Results

The end result of the training of the model yielded around 80% prediction accuracy
